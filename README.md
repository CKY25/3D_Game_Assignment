# Paws & Puzzles Escape Meow-nia
This is my BACS3254 3D Game Development Assignment. This is a puzzle game where player roleplay as a cat who has undergone various experiments and possess telekinesis ability. The goal for the player is to escape from the experiment laboratory by finding out the passwords for the doors, collecting keys from the NPC security to access with the capsules, collecting capsules that will unlock the door and solving questions that involved base64 and ROT13 encoded strings. Players are able to customize their cat's skin to their favour.

Special Features:</br>
⦁ Players can roleplay as a cat and solve puzzles with the perspective of a cat. </br>
⦁ Players can customize their cat's skin according to their favour. </br>
⦁ This game introduces a simple password encryption method to the player which is the base64 and ROT13. </br>

Weakness:</br>
Since this project is done during the short semester which is only 7 weeks, we had less than a month time to develop this project, so there is no complex game mechanic in this game.
